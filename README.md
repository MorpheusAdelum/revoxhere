### Hi there, I'm Robert - aka revox 👋 
I'm 17, I live in a small village and study as electronics technician :books: in Bydgoszcz (Poland).<br>
I can be described as anxious, sometimes a bit lost but most of the time ambitious IT and electronics enthusiast ♐.<br>
I really like working with Python :snake: and HTML/CSS/JS :spider_web:. I also like playing around with Arduino, C, C++ 🏗️ and Ruby :gem:.<br>
My main project (which I'm kinda proud of 😎) is [Duino-Coin](https://duinocoin.com) - a coin 💲 that can be mined with AVR boards (like Arduino) - you can check it out if you have some free time :smiley:
