### Hi there, I'm Robert - aka revox ðŸ‘‹
I'm 17, I study as electronics technician in Bydgoszcz, Poland. I can be described as anxious, sometimes a bit lost but most of the time ambitious IT and electronics enthusiast. My main project which I'm kinda proud of, is [Duino-Coin](https://duinocoin.com) - a cryptocurrency that can be mined with AVR boards - check it out if you have some free time!
